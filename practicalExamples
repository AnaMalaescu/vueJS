The philosophy behind Vue.js is to provide the simplest possible API for creating real-time, 
two-way data binding between the view (HTML) and the model (a JavaScript object).

1. Navigation Menu
The model, or in other words our app's data. 
  In Vue.js this is simply a JavaScript object containing variables and their initial values.
An HTML template, the correct terminology for which is view. 
  Here we chose what to display, add event listeners, and handle different usages for the model.
ViewModel - a Vue instance that binds the model and view together, enabling them to communicate with each other.
