<div id="app"> / <div class="app">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>

new Vue({
  el: '#app', // el:'.app'
  data: {
    message: 'Hello World!'
  }
})


<span v-bind:title="message">

The v-bind attribute you are seeing is called a directive.
Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special 
attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM.

<div id="app-3">
  <span v-if="seen">Now you see me</span>
</div>

var app3 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-3',
  data: {
    seen: true
  }
})

This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, 
but also the structure of the DOM. Moreover, Vue also provides a 
powerful transition effect system that can automatically apply transition effects 
when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue.
