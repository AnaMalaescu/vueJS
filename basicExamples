<div id="app"> / <div class="app">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>

new Vue({
  el: '#app', // el:'.app'
  data: {
    message: 'Hello World!'
  }
})


<span v-bind:title="message">

The v-bind attribute you are seeing is called a directive.
Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special 
attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM.
